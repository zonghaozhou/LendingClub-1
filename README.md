# LendingClub

Background: 
Lending Club is the world’s largest online platform where a person or business can apply for a loan. It joins investors with the borrower so that the investors get great returns compared to savings and investment products offered by banks whereas borrowers get the loan at a lower interest rate. When a customer applies for the loan, the lending club assesses risk, determining credit rating, and assigns appropriate interest rates using online data and technology. The major challenges of the company are to improve loan default rates and assign an appropriate interest rate to the customers. 

Problem statement: 
How can the lending club reduce loan defaults rate and improve profitability based on the customer’s past data? 

Data and problem approach:
The data for this project is publicly available in https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club?fbclid=IwAR3w5sPGkv8me56k9h4KCwcokFZNCfZAM7H-oyiVR-_5TZA1VHpfIM8RNO0.  The lending club provides approximately 12 years (2007-2018) of data which contains costumer’s past information such as loan amount, interest rates, income, installments, and many others.
The approach for this project was to start with cleaning the data and reduces it to a manageable size. The past behavior of the customers were be analyzed by exploratory data analysis. The interest rate and loan status were predicted by using Machine learning approaches, then the model’s performance was evaluated.
